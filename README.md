• Quartz
It is a richly featured, open source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the largest e-commerce system. Quartz can be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard Java components that may execute virtually anything you may program them to do. The Quartz Scheduler includes many enterprise-class features, such as support for JTA transactions and clustering.

• Interface
Triggers allow application developers to plug in rules for when and how often a task should run. The trigger can be as simple as a single, absolute date-time or can include Java™ EE business calendar logic. A Trigger implementation is created by the application developer (or may be supplied to the application externally) and is registered with a task when it is submitted to a ManagedScheduledExecutorService using any of the schedule methods. Each method will run with unspecified context. The methods can be made contextual through creating contextual proxy objects using ContextService.

• SQL is the most common language for extracting and organising data that is stored in a relational database. A database is a table that consists of rows and columns. SQL is the language of databases.
