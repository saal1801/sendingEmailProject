The Queue interface of the Java collections framework provides the functionality of the queue data structure. It extends the Collection interface.

Interface Trigger
Triggers allow application developers to plug in rules for when and how often a task should run. The trigger can be as simple as a single, absolute date-time or can include Javaâ„¢ EE business calendar logic. A Trigger implementation is created by the application developer (or may be supplied to the application externally) and is registered with a task when it is submitted to a ManagedScheduledExecutorService using any of the schedule methods. Each method will run with unspecified context. The methods can be made contextual through creating contextual proxy objects using ContextService.
